Fall 2023 EDAV Community Contribution: Correlation Matrices

This Repo has the code to make correlation matrices, with hierarchical clustering implemented to sort rows and columns. This was created as part of a project for Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization, as part of the
M.S. in Data Science curriculum at Columbia University. Feel free to reach out if there are any questions!
